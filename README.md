# arpatoddler
An Arduino based arpeggiator music boxy thingy that toddlers can play with

## Rough idea
It will be a light and small box with 8 switches that will control 8 notes that are meant to be played in sequence. Some knobs will control tempo, sound colour, volume etc. Each note will have a led (rgb led) the colour of the led indicating which note will be played. If led is off it means no note will sound. When a note switch is pressed it cycles through the colours till it is turned off. White can be the colour the led takes when the respective note is being played.

## Shopping list
- Yamaha YM2612 sound chip. Who knows... it has its own DAC.
- 8 RGB leds (diffused light better I think)
- 4 Potentiometers (knobs)
- 8 Momentary switches
- Arduino Uno (do we need mega?)
